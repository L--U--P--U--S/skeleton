antiSMASH skeleton to assist plugin development
===============================================

This script is designed to help writing antiSMASH plugins without having to have
the full antiSMASH script up and running.

**Note:** So far, only cluster detection plugins are supported.

**Note2:** This is a copy of https://bitbucket.org/kblin/skeleton - adding a python implementation of CASSIS (https://sbi.hki-jena.de/cassis/)
